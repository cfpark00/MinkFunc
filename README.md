## _datatools_
Oct-tree and quad-tree structure to handle point samples.
Main features: Tree structure, Calculation of Box-counting Plot, weighted random down sampling.

## MF
Python implementation of Minkowski Functional calculator using the Germ--Grain model. Compuation based on Voronoi tesselations
Main feature: Calculation of Minkowski Functionals in *R* <sup>3</sup> based on Voronoi tesselations. Boundaries can be masked or optimized.

## DTFE
Python implementation of Delaunay Tesselation Field estimator.

## CorrSp
Code to find n-points overlapping within radius R for all n. Very slow for dense population.
