# _MinkFunc_
Tools for geometrical analysis of point samples, especially for cosmology. Written for Python 3.  
Requires: numpy, scipy, matplotlib  
Contact: cfpark00@gmail.com  /  cfpark00.github.io

## _datatools_
Oct-tree and quad-tree structure to handle point samples.  
Main features: Tree structure, Calculation of Box-counting Plot, weighted random down sampling.

## MF
Python implementation of Minkowski Functional calculation of the Germ--Grain model. Compuation based on Voronoi tesselations
Main feature: Calculation of Minkowski Functionals in *R* <sup>3</sup> based on Voronoi tesselations. Boundaries can be masked or optimized.

## DTFE
Python implementation of Delaunay Tesselation Field estimator.

## CorrSp
Code to find n-points overlapping within radius R for all n. Very slow for dense samples.
